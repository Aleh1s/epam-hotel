## Requirements for the project
The client registers in the system and makes an Application, which indicates the number of guests, apartment class and length of stay. The customer can also select a room from the list of available rooms and book it. An unregistered user cannot leave a request or book a room. Implement sorting for the list of rooms:
> 1. _by price;_
> 2. _by number of persons;_
> 3. _by class;_
> 4. _by status (free, booked, busy, unavailable)._

The manager reviews the received applications, selects the most favorite of the available numbers and sends a request to the customer to confirm the reservation. The request is displayed in the user's personal account. After the room is booked, the system issues an invoice to the customer, which must be paid within two days. If the bill is not paid, the reservation is automatically withdrawn.
